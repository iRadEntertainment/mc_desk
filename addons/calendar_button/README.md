![](icon.png)

This will add a CalendarButton node that allows you to easily select a date without having to do all the work of creating your own Calendar and Date classes.
Very easy to use.

-----------

## How to implement in your project

1. Place CalendarButton in your scene
2. From a script of your choice, get the CalendarButton node
3. Using the node, add a connection: calendar_button_node.connect("date_selected", self, "your_func_here")
4. Create a function "func your_func_here(date_obj)". Note that it expect an argument.
5. Do a test inside "your_func_here", such as:  print(date_obj.date())

-----------

**Code Example:**

func _ready():
	var calendar_button_node = get_node("path/to/CalendarButton")
	calendar_button_node.connect("date_selected", self, "your_func_here")

func your_func_here(date_obj):
	print(date_obj.date()) # Use the date_obj wisely :)
